            "Let's start with some commonly asked machine learning interview questions and answers.\n",
            "1. What Are the Different Types of Machine Learning?\n",
            "There are three types of machine learning:\n",
            "Supervised Learning\n",
            "In supervised machine learning, a model makes predictions or decisions based on past or labeled data. Labeled data refers to sets of data that are given tags or labels, and thus made more meaningful.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unsupervised Learning\n",
            "In unsupervised learning, we don't have labeled data. A model can identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the input data.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reinforcement Learning\n",
            "Using reinforcement learning, the model can learn based on the rewards it received for its previous action.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consider an environment where an agent is working. The agent is given a target to achieve. Every time the agent takes some action toward the target, it is given positive feedback. And, if the action taken is going away from the goal, the agent is given negative feedback. \n",
            "Also Read: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning in Machine Learning\n",
            "2. What is Overfitting, and How Can You Avoid It? \n",
            "The Overfitting is a situation that occurs when a model learns the training set too well, taking up random fluctuations in the training data as concepts. These impact the model’s ability to generalize and don’t apply to new data. \n",
            "When a model is given the training data, it shows 100 percent accuracy—technically a slight loss. But, when we use the test data, there may be an error and low efficiency. This condition is known as overfitting.\n",
            "There are multiple ways of avoiding overfitting, such as:\n",
            "\n",
            "Regularization. It involves a cost term for the features involved with the objective function\n",
            "Making a simple model. With lesser variables and parameters, the variance can be reduced \n",
            "Cross-validation methods like k-folds can also be used\n",
            "If some model parameters are likely to cause overfitting, techniques for regularization like LASSO can be used that penalize these parameters\n",
            "\n",

            "3. What is ‘training Set’ and ‘test Set’ in a Machine Learning Model? How Much Data Will You Allocate for Your Training, Validation, and Test Sets?\n",
            "There is a three-step process followed to create a model:\n",
            "\n",
            "Train the model\n",
            "Test the model \n",
            "Deploy the model\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Training Set\n",
            "Test Set\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The training set is examples given to the model to analyze and learn\n",
            "70% of the total data is typically taken as the training dataset\n",
            "This is labeled data used to train the model\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The test set is used to test the accuracy of the hypothesis generated by the model\n",
            "Remaining 30% is taken as testing dataset\n",
            "We test without labeled data and then verify results with labels\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Consider a case where you have labeled data for 1,000 records. One way to train the model is to expose all 1,000 records during the training process. Then you take a small set of the same data to test the model, which would give good results in this case.\n",
            "But, this is not an accurate way of testing. So, we set aside a portion of that data called the ‘test set’ before starting the training process. The remaining data is called the ‘training set’ that we use for training the model. The training set passes through the model multiple times until the accuracy is high, and errors are minimized.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, we pass the test data to check if the model can accurately predict the values and determine if training is effective. If you get errors, you either need to change your model or retrain it with more data.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regarding the question of how to split the data into a training set and test set, there is no fixed rule, and the ratio can vary based on individual preferences. \n",
            "4. How Do You Handle Missing or Corrupted Data in a Dataset?\n",
            "One of the easiest ways to handle missing or corrupted data is to drop those rows or columns or replace them entirely with some other value.\n",
            "There are two useful methods in Pandas:\n",
            "\n",
            "IsNull() and dropna() will help to find the columns/rows with missing data and drop them\n",
            "Fillna() will replace the wrong values with a placeholder value\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "5. How Can You Choose a Classifier Based on a Training Set Data Size?\n",
            "When the training set is small, a model that has a right bias and low variance seems to work better because they are less likely to overfit. \n",
            "For example, Naive Bayes works best when the training set is large. Models with low bias and high variance tend to perform better as they work fine with complex relationships.\n",
            "PCP in AI and Machine LearningIn Partnership with Purdue UniversityExplore Course\n",
            "6. Explain the Confusion Matrix with Respect to Machine Learning Algorithms.\n",
            "A confusion matrix (or error matrix) is a specific table that is used to measure the performance of an algorithm. It is mostly used in supervised learning; in unsupervised learning, it’s called the matching matrix.\n",
            "The confusion matrix has two parameters:\n",
            "\n",
            "Actual\n",
            "Predicted \n",
            "\n",
            "It also has identical sets of features in both of these dimensions.\n",
            "Consider a confusion matrix (binary matrix) shown below:\n",
            "\n",
            "Here,\n",
            "For actual values:\n",
            "Total Yes = 12+1 = 13\n",
            "Total No = 3+9 = 12 \n",
            "Similarly, for predicted values:\n",
            "Total Yes = 12+3 = 15\n",
            "Total No = 1+9 = 10 \n",
            "For a model to be accurate, the values across the diagonals should be high. The total sum of all the values in the matrix equals the total observations in the test data set. \n",
            "For the above matrix, total observations = 12+3+1+9 = 25\n",
            "Now, accuracy = sum of the values across the diagonal/total dataset\n",
            "= (12+9) / 25\n",
            "= 21 / 25\n",
            "= 84%\n",
            "7. What Is a False Positive and False Negative and How Are They Significant?\n",
            "False positives are those cases that wrongly get classified as True but are False. \n",
            "False negatives are those cases that wrongly get classified as False but are True.\n",
            "In the term ‘False Positive,’ the word ‘Positive’ refers to the ‘Yes’ row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix. The complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as a positive, but the actual value is negative. \n",
            "\n",
            "So, looking at the confusion matrix, we get:\n",
            "False-positive = 3\n",
            "True positive = 12\n",
            "Similarly, in the term ‘False Negative,’ the word ‘Negative’ refers to the ‘No’ row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix. And the complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as negative, but the actual value is positive.\n",
            "So, looking at the confusion matrix, we get:\n",
            "False Negative = 1\n",
            "True Negative = 9\n",
            "8. What Are the Three Stages of Building a Model in Machine Learning?\n",
            "The three stages of building a machine learning model are:\n",

            "9. What is Deep Learning?\n",
            "The Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves systems that think and learn like humans using artificial neural networks. The term ‘deep’ comes from the fact that you can have several layers of neural networks. \n",
            "One of the primary differences between machine learning and deep learning is that feature engineering is done manually in machine learning. In the case of deep learning, the model consisting of neural networks will automatically determine which features to use (and which not to use). \n",

            "Bias\n",
            "Bias in a machine learning model occurs when the predicted values are further from the actual values. Low bias indicates a model where the prediction values are very close to the actual ones.\n",
            "Underfitting: High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs. \n",
            "Variance\n",
            "Variance refers to the amount the target model will change when trained with different training data. For a good model, the variance should be minimized. \n",

            "26. What is the Trade-off Between Bias and Variance?\n",
            "The bias-variance decomposition essentially decomposes the learning error from any algorithm by adding the bias, variance, and a bit of irreducible error due to noise in the underlying dataset. \n",
            "Necessarily, if you make the model more complex and add more variables, you’ll lose bias but gain variance. To get the optimally-reduced amount of error, you’ll have to trade off bias and variance. Neither high bias nor high variance is desired.\n",
            "High bias and low variance algorithms train models that are consistent, but inaccurate on average.\n",
            "High variance and low bias algorithms train models that are accurate but inconsistent. \n",

            "A decision tree builds classification (or regression) models as a tree structure, with datasets broken up into ever-smaller subsets while developing the decision tree, literally in a tree-like way with branches and nodes. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data. \n",
            "29. What is Pruning in Decision Trees, and How Is It Done?\n",
            "Pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees. It reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting. \n",
            "Pruning can occur in:\n",
            "\n",
            "Top-down fashion. It will traverse nodes and trim subtrees starting at the root\n",

            "\n",
            "Observe that all five selected points do not belong to the same cluster. There are three tennis balls and one each of basketball and football. \n",
            "When multiple classes are involved, we prefer the majority. Here the majority is with the tennis ball, so the new data point is assigned to this cluster.\n",

            "\n",
            "A list of frequently asked machine learning interview questions and answers are given below.\n",
            "1) What do you understand by Machine learning?\n",
            "Machine learning is the form of Artificial Intelligence that deals with system programming and automates data analysis to enable computers to learn and act through experiences without being explicitly programmed.\n",
            "For example, Robots are coded in such a way that they can perform the tasks based on data they collect from sensors. They automatically learn programs from data and improve with experiences.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "2) Differentiate between inductive learning and deductive learning?\n",
            "In inductive learning, the model learns by examples from a set of observed instances to draw a generalized conclusion. On the other side, in deductive learning, the model first applies the conclusion, and then the conclusion is drawn.\n",
            "\n",
            "Inductive learning is the method of using observations to draw conclusions.\n",
            "Deductive learning is the method of using conclusions to form observations.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, if we have to explain to a kid that playing with fire can cause burns. There are two ways we can explain this to a kid; we can show training examples of various fire accidents or images of burnt people and label them as \"Hazardous\". In this case, a kid will understand with the help of examples and not play with the fire. It is the form of Inductive machine learning. The other way to teach the same thing is to let the kid play with the fire and wait to see what happens. If the kid gets a burn, it will teach the kid not to play with fire and avoid going near it. It is the form of deductive learning.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) What is the difference between Data Mining and Machine Learning?\n",
            "Data mining can be described as the process in which the structured data tries to abstract knowledge or interesting unknown patterns. During this process, machine learning algorithms are used.\n",
            "Machine learning represents the study, design, and development of the algorithms which provide the ability to the processors to learn without being explicitly programmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "4) What is the meaning of Overfitting in Machine learning?\n",
            "Overfitting can be seen in machine learning when a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting is usually observed when a model is excessively complex. It happens because of having too many parameters concerning the number of training data types. The model displays poor performance, which has been overfitted.\n",
            "\n",
            "5) Why overfitting occurs?\n",
            "The possibility of overfitting occurs when the criteria used for training the model is not as per the criteria used to judge the efficiency of a model.\n",
            "\n",
            "6) What is the method to avoid overfitting?\n",
            "Overfitting occurs when we have a small dataset, and a model is trying to learn from it. By using a large amount of data, overfitting can be avoided. But if we have a small database and are forced to build a model based on that, then we can use a technique known as cross-validation. In this method, a model is usually given a dataset of a known data on which training data set is run and dataset of unknown data against which the model is tested. The primary aim of cross-validation is to define a dataset to \"test\" the model in the training phase. If there is sufficient data, 'Isotonic Regression' is used to prevent overfitting.\n",
            "\n",
            "7) Differentiate supervised and unsupervised machine learning.\n",
            "\n",
            "In supervised machine learning, the machine is trained using labeled data. Then a new dataset is given into the learning model so that the algorithm provides a positive outcome by analyzing the labeled data. For example, we first require to label the data which is necessary to train the model while performing classification.\n",
            "In the unsupervised machine learning, the machine is not trained using labeled data and let the algorithms make the decisions without any corresponding output variables.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "8) How does Machine Learning differ from Deep Learning?\n",
            "\n",
            "Machine learning is all about algorithms which are used to parse data, learn from that data, and then apply whatever they have learned to make informed decisions.\n",
            "Deep learning is a part of machine learning, which is inspired by the structure of the human brain and is particularly useful in feature detection.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "9) How is KNN different from k-means?\n",
            "KNN or K nearest neighbors is a supervised algorithm which is used for classification purpose. In KNN, a test sample is given as the class of the majority of its nearest neighbors. On the other side, K-means is an unsupervised algorithm which is mainly used for clustering. In k-means clustering, it needs a set of unlabeled points and a threshold only. The algorithm further takes unlabeled data and learns how to cluster it into groups by computing the mean of the distance between different unlabeled points.\n",
            "\n",
            "10) What are the different types of Algorithm methods in Machine Learning?\n",
            "The different types of algorithm methods in machine earning are:\n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "11) What do you understand by Reinforcement Learning technique?\n",
            "Reinforcement learning is an algorithm technique used in Machine Learning. It involves an agent that interacts with its environment by producing actions & discovering errors or rewards. Reinforcement learning is employed by different software and machines to search for the best suitable behavior or path it should follow in a specific situation. It usually learns on the basis of reward or penalty given for every action it performs.\n",
            "\n",
            "12) What is the trade-off between bias and variance?\n",
            "Both bias and variance are errors. Bias is an error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. It can lead to the model under-fitting the data, making it hard to have high predictive accuracy and generalize the knowledge from the training set to the test set.\n",
            "Variance is an error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm. It leads to the algorithm being highly sensitive to high degrees of variation in the training data, which can lead the model to overfit the data.\n",
            "To optimally reduce the number of errors, we will need to tradeoff bias and variance.\n",
            "\n",

            "Regularization is necessary whenever the model begins to overfit/ underfit. It is a cost term for bringing in more features with the objective function. Hence, it tries to push the coefficients for many variables to zero and reduce cost term. It helps to reduce model complexity so that the model can become better at predicting (generalizing).\n",

            "47) What is Regularization? What kind of problems does regularization solve?\n",
            "A regularization is a form of regression, which constrains/ regularizes or shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. In other words, it discourages learning a more complex or flexible model to avoid the risk of overfitting. It reduces the variance of the model, without a substantial increase in its bias. \n",

            "1. Explain Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep LearningIt is common to get confused between the three in-demand technologies, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning. These three technologies, though a little different from one another, are interrelated. While Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Since some terms and techniques may overlap in these technologies, it is easy to get confused among them.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, let us learn about these technologies in detail:\n",
            "\n",
            "Machine Learning: Machine Learning involves various statistical and Deep Learning techniques that allow machines to use their past experiences and get better at performing specific tasks without having to be monitored.\n",
            "Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence uses numerous Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques that enable computer systems to perform tasks using human-like intelligence with logic and rules. Artificial intelligence is used in every sector hence it is necessary to pursue Artificial Intelligence Course to make your career in AI.\n",
            "Deep Learning: Deep Learning comprises several algorithms that enable software to learn from themselves and perform various business tasks including image and speech recognition. Deep Learning is possible when systems expose their multilayered neural networks to large volumes of data for learning.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. What is Bias and Variance in Machine Learning?\n",
            "Bias is the difference between the average prediction of a model and the correct value of the model. If the bias value is high, then the prediction of the model is not accurate. Hence, the bias value should be as low as possible to make the desired predictions.\n",
            "Variance is the number that gives the difference of prediction over a training set and the anticipated value of other training sets. High variance may lead to large fluctuation in the output. Therefore, a model’s output should have low variance.\n",
            "\n",
            "The following diagram shows the bias-variance trade-off:\n",
            "\n",
            "Here, the desired result is the blue circle at the center. If we get off from the blue section, then the prediction goes wrong.\n",

            "\n",
            "3. What is Clustering in Machine Learning?Clustering is a technique used in unsupervised learning that involves grouping data points. The clustering algorithm can be used with a set of data points. This technique will allow you to classify all data points into their particular groups. The data points that are thrown into the same category have similar features and properties, while the data points that belong to different groups have distinct features and properties. Statistical data analysis can be performed by this method. Let us take a look at three of the most popular and useful clustering algorithms.\n",
            "\n",
            "K-means clustering: This algorithm is commonly used when there is data with no specific group or category. K-means clustering allows you to find the hidden patterns in the data, which can be used to classify the data into various groups. The variable k is used to represent the number of groups the data is divided into, and the data points are clustered using the similarity of features. Here, the centroids of the clusters are used for labeling new data.\n",
            "Mean-shift clustering: The main aim of this algorithm is to update the center-point candidates to be mean and find the center points of all groups. In mean-shift clustering, unlike k-means clustering, the possible number of clusters need not be selected as it can automatically be discovered by the mean shift.\n",
            "Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN): This clustering algorithm is based on density and has similarities with mean-shift clustering. There is no need to preset the number of clusters, but unlike mean-shift clustering, DBSCAN identifies outliers and treats them like noise. Moreover, it can identify arbitrarily-sized and -shaped clusters without much effort.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "4. What is Linear Regression in Machine Learning?Linear Regression is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm. It is used to find the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables for predictive analysis.\n",
            "The equation for Linear Regression:\n",
            "\n",
            "where:\n",
            "\n",
            "X is the input or independent variable\n",
            "Y is the output or dependent variable\n",
            "a is the intercept, and b is the coefficient of X\n",
            "\n",
            "Below is the best-fit line that shows the data of weight, Y or the dependent variable, and the\n",
            "\n",
            "ata of height, X or the independent variable, of 21-year-old candidates scattered over the plot. The straight line shows the best linear relationship that would help in predicting the weight of candidates according to their height.\n",
            "To get this best-fit line, the best values of a and b should be found. By adjusting the values of a and b, the errors in the prediction of Y can be reduced.\n",
            "This is how linear regression helps in finding the linear relationship and predicting the output.\n",

            "5. What is a Decision Tree in Machine Learning?A decision tree is used to explain the sequence of actions that must be performed to get the desired output. It is a hierarchical diagram that shows the actions.\n",
            "\n",
            "An algorithm can be created for a decision tree on the basis of the set hierarchy of actions.\n",
            "In the above decision-tree diagram, a sequence of actions has been made for driving a vehicle with or without a license.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. What is Overfitting in Machine Learning and how can it be avoided?Overfitting happens when a machine has an inadequate dataset and tries to learn from it. So, overfitting is inversely proportional to the amount of data.\n",
            "For small databases, overfitting can be bypassed by the cross-validation method. In this approach, a dataset is divided into two sections. These two sections will comprise the testing and training dataset. To train a model, the training dataset is used, and for testing the model for new inputs, the testing dataset is used.\n",
            "This is how to avoid overfitting.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. What is Hypothesis in Machine Learning?Machine Learning allows the use of available dataset to understand a specific function that maps input to output in the best possible way. This problem is known as function approximation. Here, approximation needs to be used for the unknown target function that maps all plausible observations based on the given problem in the best manner. Hypothesis in Machine learning is a model that helps in approximating the target function and performing the necessary input-to-output mappings. The choice and configuration of algorithms allow defining the space of plausible hypotheses that may be represented by a model.\n",
            "In the hypothesis, lowercase h (h) is used for a specific hypothesis, while uppercase h (H) is used for the hypothesis space that is being searched. Let us briefly understand these notations:\n",
            "\n",
            "Hypothesis (h): A hypothesis is a specific model that helps in mapping input to output; the mapping can further be used for evaluation and prediction.\n",
            "Hypothesis set (H): Hypothesis set consists of a space of hypotheses that can be used to map inputs to outputs, which can be searched. The general constraints include the choice of problem framing, the model, and the model configuration.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "8. What are the differences between Deep Learning and Machine Learning?\n",
            "Deep Learning: Deep Learning allows machines to make various business-related decisions using artificial neural networks, which is one of the reasons why it needs a vast amount of data for training. Since there is a lot of computing power required, Deep Learning requires high-end systems as well. The systems acquire various properties and features with the help of the given data, and the problem is solved using an end-to-end method.\n",
            "Machine Learning: Machine Learning gives machines the ability to make business decisions without any external help, using the knowledge gained from past data. Machine Learning systems require relatively small amounts of data to train themselves, and most of the features need to be manually coded and understood in advance. In Machine Learning, a given business problem is dissected into two and then solved individually. Once the solutions of both have been acquired, they are then combined.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "9. What are the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning?\n",
            "Supervised learning: The algorithms of supervised learning use labeled data to get trained. The models take direct feedback to confirm whether the output that is being predicted is, indeed, correct. Moreover, both the input data and the output data are provided to the model, and the main aim here is to train the model to predict the output upon receiving new data. Supervised learning offers accurate results and can largely be divided into two parts, classification and regression.\n",
            "Unsupervised learning: The algorithms of unsupervised learning use unlabeled data for training purposes. In unsupervised learning, the models identify hidden data trends and do not take any feedback. The unsupervised learning model is only provided with input data. Unsupervised learning’s main aim is to identify hidden patterns to extract information from unknown sets of data. It can also be classified into two parts, clustering, and associations. Unfortunately, unsupervised learning offers results that are comparatively less accurate.\n",

            "10. What is Bayes’s Theorem in Machine Learning?Bayes’s theorem offers the probability of any given event to occur using prior knowledge. In mathematical terms, it can be defined as the true positive rate of the given sample condition divided by the sum of the true positive rate of the said condition and the false positive rate of the entire population.\n",
            "Two of the most significant applications of Bayes’s theorem in Machine Learning are Bayesian optimization and Bayesian belief networks. This theorem is also the foundation behind the Machine Learning brand that involves the Naive Bayes classifier.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "11. What is PCA in Machine Learning?Multidimensional data is at play in the real world. Data visualization and computation become more challenging with the increase in dimensions. In such a scenario, the dimensions of data might have to be reduced to analyze and visualize it easily. This is done by:\n",

            "Keeping only the most relevant dimensions\n",
            "\n",
            "This is where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used.\n",
            "The goal of PCA is to find a fresh collection of uncorrelated dimensions (orthogonal) and rank them on the basis of variance.\n",
            "Mechanism of PCA:\n",

            "Compute the covariance matrix for data objects\n",
            "Compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues in descending order\n",
            "Select the initial N eigenvectors to get new dimensions\n",
            "Finally, change the initial n-dimensional data objects into N-dimensions\n",
            "\n",
            "Example: Below are two graphs showing data points or objects and two directions, one is green and the other is yellow. Graph 2 is arrived at by rotating Graph 1 so that the x-axis and y-axis represent the green and yellow direction respectively.\n",

            "Unsupervised learning: This type of Machine Learning has unlabeled data unlike supervised learning. Unsupervised learning works on data under absolutely no supervision. Unsupervised learning tries to identify patterns in data and makes clusters of similar entities. After that, when a new input data is fed into the model, it does not identify the entity; rather, it puts the entity in a cluster of similar objects.\n",

            "17. Differentiate between Classification and Regression in Machine LearningIn Machine Learning, there are various types of prediction problems based on supervised and unsupervised learning. They are classification, regression, clustering, and association. Here, we will discuss classification and regression.\n",
            "Classification: In classification, a Machine Learning model is created that assists in differentiating data into separate categories. The data is labeled and categorized based on the input parameters.\n",
            "For example, predictions have to be made on the churning out customers for a particular product based on some recorded data. Either the customers will churn out or they will not. So, the labels for this would be “Yes” and “No.”\n",
            "Regression: It is the process of creating a model for distinguishing data into continuous real values, instead of using classes or discrete values. It can also identify the distribution movement depending on historical data. It is used for predicting the occurrence of an event depending on the degree of association of variables.\n",
            "For example, the prediction of weather conditions depends on factors such as temperature, air pressure, solar radiation, elevation, and distance from the sea. The relation among these factors assists in predicting the weather condition.\n",
            "18. How is the suitability of a Machine Learning Algorithm determined for a particular problem?To identify a Machine Learning Algorithm for a particular problem, the following steps should be followed:\n",
            "Step 1: Problem classification: Classification of the problem depends on the classification of input and output:\n",
            "\n",
            "Classifying the input: Classification of the input depends on whether there is data labeled (supervised learning) or unlabeled (unsupervised learning), or whether a model has to be created that interacts with the environment and improves itself (reinforcement learning.)\n",
            "Classifying the output: If the output of a model is required as a class, then some classification techniques need to be used.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the output is a number, then regression techniques must be used; if the output is a different cluster of inputs, then clustering techniques should be used.\n",
            "Step 2: Checking the algorithms in hand: After classifying the problem, the available algorithms that can be deployed for solving the classified problem should be considered.\n",
            "Step 3: Implementing the algorithms: If there are multiple algorithms available, then all of them are to be implemented. Finally, the algorithm that gives the best performance is selected.\n",
            "19. What is the Variance Inflation Factor?Variance inflation factor (VIF) is the estimate of the volume of multicollinearity in a collection of many regression variables.\n",
            "VIF = Variance of the model / Variance of the model with a single independent variable\n",
            "This ratio has to be calculated for every independent variable. If VIF is high, then it shows the high collinearity of the independent variables.\n",

            "Confusion matrix gives the count of correct and incorrect values and error types. Accuracy of the model: \n",
            "\n",
            "For example, consider the following confusion matrix. It consists of values as true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative for a classification model. Now, the accuracy of the model can be calculated as follows:\n",

            "So, in the example:\n",
            "Accuracy = (200 + 50) / (200 + 50 + 10 + 60) = 0.78\n",
            "This means that the model’s accuracy is 0.78, corresponding to its True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative values.\n",
            "21. What are Type I and Type II Errors?Type I Error: Type I Error, false positive, is an error where the outcome of a test shows the nonacceptance of a true condition.\n",
            "For example, suppose a person gets diagnosed with depression even when they are not suffering from the same, it is a case of false positive.\n",
            "Type II Error: Type II Error, false negative, is an error where the outcome of a test shows the acceptance of a false condition.\n",
            "For example, the CT scan of a person shows that they do not have a disease but in fact they do have the disease. Here, the test accepts the false condition that the person does not have the disease. This is a case of false negative.\n",
            "22. When should Classification be used over Regression?Both classification and regression are associated with prediction. Classification involves the identification of values or entities that lie in a specific group. Regression entails predicting a response value from consecutive sets of outcomes.\n",
            "Classification is chosen over regression when the output of the model needs to yield the belongingness of data points in a dataset to a particular category.\n",
            "For example, If you want to predict the price of a house, you should use regression since it is a numerical variable. However, if you are trying to predict whether a house situated in a particular area is going to be high-, medium-, or low-priced, then a classification model should be used.\n",
            "23. Explain Logistic RegressionLogistic regression is the proper regression analysis used when the dependent variable is categorical or binary. Like all regression analyses, logistic regression is a technique for predictive analysis. Logistic regression is used to explain data and the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables. Logistic regression is also employed to predict the probability of categorical dependent variables.\n",

Rotation maximizes the separation within the variance obtained by the components. This makes the interpretation of the components easier.\n",
            "The motive behind conducting PCA is to choose fewer components that can explain the greatest variance in a dataset. When rotation is performed, the original coordinates of the points get changed. However, there is no change in the relative position of the components.\n",
            "If the components are not rotated, then there needs to be more extended components to describe the variance.\n",

            "\n",
            "Training dataset: Training dataset is used for building a model and adjusting its variables. The correctness of the model built on the training dataset cannot be relied on as the model might give incorrect outputs after being fed new inputs.\n",
            "Validation dataset: Validation dataset is used to look into a model’s response. After this, the hyperparameters on the basis of the estimated benchmark of the validation dataset data are tuned.When a model’s response is evaluated by using the validation dataset, the model is indirectly trained with the validation set. This may lead to the overfitting of the model to specific data. So, this model will not be strong enough to give the desired response to real-world data.\n",
            "Test dataset: Test dataset is the subset of the actual dataset, which is not yet used to train the model. The model is unaware of this dataset. So, by using the test dataset, the response of the created model can be computed on hidden data. The model’s performance is tested on the basis of the test dataset.Note: The model is always exposed to the test dataset after tuning the hyperparameters on top of the validation dataset.\n",
            "\n",
            "As we know, the evaluation of the model on the basis of the validation dataset would not be enough. Thus, the test dataset is used for computing the efficiency of the model.\n",

            "28. Explain the difference between KNN and K-means ClusteringK-nearest neighbors (KNN): It is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm. In KNN, identified or labeled data is given to the model. The model then matches the points based on the distance from the closest points.\n",
            "\n",
            "K-means clustering: It is an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm. In K-means clustering, unidentified or unlabeled data is given to the model. The algorithm then creates batches of points based on the average of the distances between distinct points.\n",

            "29. What is Dimensionality Reduction?In the real world, Machine Learning models are built on top of features and parameters. These features can be multidimensional and large in number. Sometimes, the features may be irrelevant and it becomes a difficult task to visualize them.\n",
            "This is where dimensionality reduction is used to cut down irrelevant and redundant features with the help of principal variables. These principal variables conserve the features, and are a subgroup, of the parent variables.\n",
            "30. Both being Tree-based Algorithms, how is Random Forest different from Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)?The main difference between a random forest and GBM is the use of techniques. Random forest advances predictions using a technique called bagging. On the other hand, GBM advances predictions with the help of a technique called boosting.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bagging: In bagging, we apply arbitrary sampling and we divide the dataset into N. After that, we build a model by employing a single training algorithm. Following that, we combine the final predictions by polling. Bagging helps to increase the efficiency of a model by decreasing the variance to eschew overfitting.\n",
            "Boosting: In boosting, the algorithm tries to review and correct the inadmissible predictions at the initial iteration. After that, the algorithm’s sequence of iterations for correction continues until we get the desired prediction. Boosting assists in reducing bias and variance for strengthening the weak learners.\n",

            "31. What is meant by Parametric and Non-parametric Models?Parametric models refer to the models having a limited number of parameters. In case of parametric models, only the parameter of a model is needed to be known to make predictions regarding the new data.\n",
            "Non-parametric models do not have any restrictions on the number of parameters, which makes new data predictions more flexible. In case of non-parametric models, the knowledge of model parameters and the state of the data needs to be known to make predictions.\n",
            "32. Differentiate between Sigmoid and Softmax FunctionsSigmoid and Softmax functions differ based on their usage in Machine Learning task classification. Sigmoid function is used in the case of binary classification, while Softmax function is used in case of multi-classification.\n",
            "33. In Machine Learning, for how many classes can Logistic Regression be used?Logistic regression cannot be used for more than two classes. Logistic regression is, by default, a binary classifier. However, in cases where multi-class classification problems need to be solved, the default number of classes can be extended, i.e., multinomial logistic regression.\n",
            "34. What do you understand about the P-value?P-value is used in decision-making while testing a hypothesis. The null hypothesis is rejected at the minimum significance level of the P-value. A lower P-value indicates that the null hypothesis is to be rejected.\n",

The values that are less than the threshold are set to 0 and the values that are greater than the threshold are set to 1. This process is useful when feature engineering has to be performed. This can also be used for adding unique features. Data can be binarized using Scikit-learn. The code for binarizing data using Binarizer is as follows:\n",

How?When one-hot encoding is used, there is an increase in the dimensionality of a dataset. The reason for the increase in dimensionality is that every class in categorical variables, forms a different variable.\n",
            "Example: Suppose there is a variable “Color.” It has three sublevels, “Yellow,” “Purple,” and “Orange.” So, one-hot encoding “Color” will create three different variables as Color.Yellow, Color.Purple, and Color.Orange.\n",
            "In label encoding, the subclasses of a certain variable get the value 0 and 1. So, label encoding is only used for binary variables.\n",
            "This is why one-hot encoding increases the dimensionality of data and label encoding does not.\n",

How does the tree determine which variable to break at the root node and which at its child nodes?Gini index and Node Entropy assist the binary classification tree to make decisions. Basically, the tree algorithm determines the feasible feature that is used to distribute data into the most genuine child nodes.\n",
            "According to the Gini index, if we arbitrarily pick a pair of objects from a group, then they should be of identical class and the probability for this event should be 1.\n",

            "Precision is defined as the percentage of True Positives to the total number of positive classifications predicted by the model. In other words,\n",
